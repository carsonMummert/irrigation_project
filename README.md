# Python-Based Irrigation Project

This project uses the wayintop irrigation kit, as well as an adafruit MCP3008 ADC to monitor and water up to 4 plants.

For right now, you simply run the program, and it outputs the soil sensor data to nice bar graphs powered by the curses python library:

	python3 irrigation_project.py

Press q to exit the program!

## Upcoming Functionality:
	- buttons to refresh all data
	- buttons to water
	- monitor last-watered dates and display them
